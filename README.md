## Ecommerce Back-End Build

# Description
This application is designed to assist organizations in storing and organizing their product catalogs while also providing basic inventory tracking functionality through RESTful APIs. Throughout the development process, I learned how to interact with MySQL databases using Sequelize and implemented robust error handling for API routes. Additionally, I gained experience in securely managing sensitive database and configuration information through the use of a separate .env file.
